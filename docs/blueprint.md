## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust and reliability, commonly associated with established e-commerce platforms.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a desaturated shade of the primary color, creating a calm and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, creating a sense of modern design.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a modern and clean aesthetic, and it works well for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, recognizable icons from a set like Material Design Icons, with a consistent stroke weight and filled style for key actions like adding to cart or navigating.
- Employ a clean and grid-based layout, similar to Amazon, that is suitable for e-commerce. Allow a lot of white space to help readability. Focus on presenting key information first.
- Use subtle transitions and animations on interactive elements (e.g., button hovers, adding to cart notifications) to provide feedback without being distracting. A simple fade or slide effect is appropriate.
